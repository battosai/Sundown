Bug (8/30)
	Villagers spawn in (seemingly) random locations after returning from hiding in their homes
	They should be spawning right at the entrances, or wherever they were close enough to the entrance
Fix (9/2)
	ENTRANCE_RADIUS in Villager.cs was never set
	Regardless, CharacterClass takePath ends at a different time than when Villager state machine switches to hiding, thus velocity is still set by takePath after going hidden
	Added callback to takePath coroutine / separated alarm state from distance to home check in a new HOME states
	Actions enum in Hitbox.cs was renamed to Act to not coincide with System.Actions used to pass methods as parameters
-----------
Bug (8/29)
	Ranger does not traverse path to alarmPoint when alarmed villagers trigger it
	Path is being found, but immediately reaches end of path somehow
Fix (9/7)
	Ranger's health was not set, thus it was exiting the takePath coroutine early
	Set it and now Ranger takes the path
-----------
Bug (9/6)
	Holding down left-click calls shapeshift from PlayerInput.cs 3 times
Fix (9/6)
	Holding down left-click shapeshifts, but hunger is still less than the forced shapeshift hunger threshold, thus reverting back to human again.
	Holding down LMouse will still be counted even if it's from the previous shapeshift, thus multiple shapeshifts
	Fixed by setting downTime in PlayerInput.cs to UNSET_TIME when forcing shapeshift
	In PlayerClass.Shapeshift() added optional isForced parameter to add FORCED_HUNGER hunger
-----------
Bug (9/18)
	Villagers in node1 (potentially all after the first one) are not pathing correctly to their homes
Fix (9/19)
	Villager Reset() was called in  Awake() function instead of Start() so it was being called before the nodeIDs were set properly.
-----------
Bug (10/1)
	Building floorHeights are messed up after adding map item spawning
Fix (10/2)
	When joining the building Start and Init function, Reset (which calls setFloorHeight) needs to be called after setting building position to point in generation
-----------
Bug (9/22)
	Villagers and Guards floorHeights are messed up
Fix (10/3)
	Sprite Renderer layer was set to Default, needed to be set to Gameground
-----------
Bug (9/7)
	Ranger spawned outside the boundaries before, keep an eye out.
	Could just use reset button to repeatedly test to see how often this happens.
	Happened once when Ranger spawned from tracking player to next node.

Bug (10/9)
	Ranger during arena fight will only shoot trishot twice for some reason
Fix (/)
-----------
Bug (3/20)
	Chest sprite's z-axis is not set properly, player appears in front when should be behind
Fix (3/23)
	Building interior prefabs' chests and beds were not synced with the prefab chest and bed, thus the sprite layer was not set to gamegroound
-----------
Bug (3/20)
	Player sprite when in building appears under the top side of the mesh
