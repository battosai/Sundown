Bug (8/30)
	Villagers spawn in (seemingly) random locations after returning from hiding in their homes
	They should be spawning right at the entrances, or wherever they were close enough to the entrance
Fix (9/2)
	ENTRANCE_RADIUS in Villager.cs was never set
	Regardless, CharacterClass takePath ends at a different time than when Villager state machine switches to hiding, thus velocity is still set by takePath after going hidden
	Added callback to takePath coroutine / separated alarm state from distance to home check in a new HOME states
	Actions enum in Hitbox.cs was renamed to Act to not coincide with System.Actions used to pass methods as parameters

	Ranger does not traverse path to alarmPoint when alarmed villagers trigger it
	Path is being found, but immediately reaches end of path somehow

Bug (9/6)
	Holding down left-click calls shapeshift from PlayerInput.cs 3 times
Fix (9/6)
	Holding down left-click shapeshifts, but hunger is still less than the forced shapeshift hunger threshold, thus reverting back to human again.
	Holding down LMouse will still be counted even if it's from the previous shapeshift, thus multiple shapeshifts
	Fixed by setting downTime in PlayerInput.cs to UNSET_TIME when forcing shapeshift
	In PlayerClass.Shapeshift() added optional isForced parameter to add FORCED_HUNGER hunger
